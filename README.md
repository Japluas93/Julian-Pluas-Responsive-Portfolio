Working on this project was a really interesting experience for me. It was definitely a great way to get more familiar with Bootstrap. I honestly can honestly say that I probably learned more from working on this assignment than I did in the whole week that my class and I were learning about this material. One thing I noticed is that my coding abilities have slightly increased in speed. Which is good! The Bootstrap helped me a lot with that process. One thing that did while working on before I started some of the library tools was creating a CSS stylesheet and I would apply all of the styles that I needed, and then I use that as reference when I was looking for some specific styling class in Bootstrap. I know this isn’t the most efficient way to go about applying features to our projects but it really me clarify what steps I needed to take to complete the next task. Overall, the project turned out really well. It’s responsive despite having a few blemishes.
